"""Think of a dictionary of at least 10 programming terms. Ask the user to input a term and show the definition as well as open the wikipedia article for the term.  If it is not known tell them and suggest some options to learn.  
Use the defenitions as values.  Lookup sleep function to open website later.
Print each word and its meaning seperately in a neat format.  Both the key and value need to have no quotes around them.  If it knows the term open a website - remember &!  If it doesnt know the term 
suggest some options.
